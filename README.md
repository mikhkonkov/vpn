## üìñ Overview

This project automates the deployment of an OpenVPN server on a DigitalOcean droplet using Terraform for infrastructure provisioning and Docker for containerized services. Once deployed, you can securely connect to your VPN using the generated client configuration file.

---

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
- A [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) account with an API token

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up your VPN server:

1. **Generate an SSH key** (if you don't already have one):

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa_do
```

2. **Copy the example environment file** and add your DigitalOcean API token:

```bash
cp example.env .env
```

Edit the `.env` file and replace `<DO_TOKEN>` with your actual DigitalOcean API token.

3. **Build the Docker image**:

```bash
docker-compose build
```

4. **Run the infrastructure container**:

```bash
docker-compose run --rm infra sh
```

5. **Initialize Terraform**:

```bash
terraform init
```

6. **Apply the Terraform configuration** to provision resources:

```bash
terraform apply
```

Confirm the changes when prompted.

7. **Retrieve the VPN server's IP address**:

```bash
terraform output vpn_server_ip
```

8. **Wait for a few minutes** to allow the server to fully initialize.

9. **Download the client configuration file**:

```bash
scp -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa_do root@<vpn_server_ip>:/root/client.ovpn ~/Downloads/client.ovpn
```

Replace `<vpn_server_ip>` with the IP address retrieved in step 7.

---

## üöÄ Usage

1. Import the downloaded `client.ovpn` file into your preferred OpenVPN client application (e.g., [OpenVPN Connect](https://openvpn.net/client-connect-vpn-for-windows/)).
2. Connect to your VPN using the imported configuration.
3. Enjoy secure internet access!
